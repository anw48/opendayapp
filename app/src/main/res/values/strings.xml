    <string name="message">It isn’t always easy to decide what you want to study
                            and where to go to university but we hope you will
                            find everything you need during our Open Day, to
                            help you with that choice. If you need any further
                            help please get in touch with a staff member in our
                            Admissions Office or in the relevant department,
                            and they will be glad to assist</string>



    <string name="message2">Aberystwyth is a well-established university with a
                            long tradition of academic excellence, but it is also
                            very forward looking. We’re small enough to be
                            friendly and to allow contact across departments,
                            but big enough to have a wide range of study
                            programmes in the Sciences, the Arts and the Social
                            Sciences, in professional and vocational subjects.</string>

    <string name="message3">Aberystwyth is a vibrant university town in a
                            stunning coastal location, with a dynamic social and
                            cultural life centred around the University. There’s
                            a tremendous range of opportunities for sports,
                            societies, activities and volunteering available to
                            you here.</string>
